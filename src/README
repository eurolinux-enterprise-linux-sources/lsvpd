BUILDING RPMS
------------------

To build a tarball to feed to rpmbuild, do
	# make dist

It is necessary to specify that the target architecture is 32 bit when 
building the rpm for this package.  

As an example, we use a command similar to the following:

> rpmbuild -ba --prefix=/usr --target=ppc --nodeps [PATH TO SPEC FILE]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This program is part of the lsvpd package for Linux\&. This package is a (partial) reimplementation of AIX's lsvpd and related commands\&.

.PP
 \fBlscfg\fR lists hardware configuration information for the system and its components\&. The output is in a human readable format\&. This implementation is merely a pretty\-printer for information that has been stored in \fBlscfg\fR's hardware inventory database at boot and hot\-plug time\&. Therefore, the \fIvpdupdate(8)\fR command must have been executed prior to running \fBlscfg\fR\&.

.PP
Some IBM POWER systems feature \fIdynamic VPD\fR\&. \fBlscfg\fR will only list this VPD when invoked by the \fIroot\fR user \- when invoked by another user this VPD will be omitted but other VPD will still be listed\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-v|\-\-verbose
Show Vital Product Data (VPD) for components, where available\&.

.TP
\-p|\-\-specific
List platform\-specific information in a separate section, where available\&.

.TP
\-l<name>|\-\-list=<name>
Only show configuration information for the component with the given operating system \fIname\fR (i\&.e\&. the \fIAX\fR field in \fBlsvpd\fR output)\&. Note that \fIname\fR may include wildcards, such as \fI*\fR and \fI?\fR (however, such wildcards should be protected from the shell)\&.

.TP
\-d<database\-file>|\-\-data=<database\-file>
Use <database\-file> as the hardware inventory database, rather than the default file (\fI/var/lib/lsvpd/vpd.db\fR)\&.

This option is useful for producing output for previous hardware inventory databases that have been replaced by the system\&.

.TP
\-z<database\-archive>|\-\-zip=<database\-archive>
Use <database\-archive> as the hardware inventory database, rather than the default directory (\fI/var/lib/lsvpd/\fR)\&. The archive is a \fItar(1)\fR archive that has been compressed using \fIgzip(1)\fR\&. It must contain a single directory containing at least a file called \fIsystem\-id\fR\&.

This option is useful for producing output for old hardware inventory databases that have been archived by the system\&.

.TP
\-h|\-\-help
Display a help screen and quit\&.

.SH "FILES"

.TP
\fI/var/lib/lsvpd/vpd.db\fR
Database file used by \fBlscfg\fR\&.

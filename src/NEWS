1.6.5
Updated glibc C header includes to new C++ standard

1.6.8: bpeters - 2/10/10
Minor update: Changed default lsvpd output to use "Size" instead 
of "SZ" for DIMM size output.  This was done to conform to the way 
AIX/lsvpd outputs this VPD

1.6.9: bpeters - 6/4/10
Minor update: Fixed location code discovery for storage
devices. Previously, a loc-code was generated simply using the device
node within the /proc/device-tree/devices file-system.  This behavior
caused usysident to get a listing of invalid loc-codes.  This patch
is a short-term fix, causing each port device to use the adapters
loc-code.  Longer-term fix will be to take this loc-code and add on
port-specific modifiers queried from the device

1.6.11: suzuki - 6/10/11
Fixed the way we find devices in /sys.  Many non-device directories
were being identified as devices.

1.7.0: suzuki - 9/10/12
Added new tool - invscout (written by Aravinda Prasad)
Better support for SCSI enclosures and SCSI devices
Dynamic system firmware level from RTAS for lsmcode.
